# âš¡ Thor â€“ A Lightning Address Server Powered by Rust and NWC

**Your domain. Your address. No node. Just Rust and NWC.**

Thor is a fast, self-hosted Lightning Address server written in Rust.

By using NWC (Nostr Wallet Connect), it allows users to receive Lightning payments through their own domain â€” **without running a Lightning Network node**.


## âœ¨ Features

- âš¡ Custom Lightning addresses like `you@yourdomain.com`
- ðŸ§  No need to run LND or Core Lightning â€” just connect to your wallet via NWC
- ðŸ¦€ High-performance and safe â€” implemented in Rust
- ðŸ§© Self-hosted and easy to deploy
- ðŸ”§ Configurable and extensible architecture (LND, CLN support planned)
